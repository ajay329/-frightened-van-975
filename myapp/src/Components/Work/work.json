    "message2": "Let us assume an individual, unfortunately, meets with an accident on the road. His medical expenses and hospital bills start piling up. Now he needs ₹5 Lakh to pay his expensive medical bills. Fortunately, his best friend signed up on Ketto’s crowdfunding platform, completed the process of submitting valid documents needed for verification. In a few minutes, he created a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for his friend’s medical expenses. Now, this campaign can be shared with all his near and dear ones through WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and E-mail. In a matter of few minutes, funds start coming in to support the financial needs of the injured friend.",
